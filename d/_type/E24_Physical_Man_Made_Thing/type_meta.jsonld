  "rdfs:comment": "# E24 Physical Man-Made Thing\r\n\r\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items that are purposely created by human activity.\r\n\r\nThis class comprises man-made objects, such as a swords, and man-made features, such as rock art. No assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding an object as man-made. For example, a \"cup and ring\" carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (E22)\r\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25)\r\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78)\r\n",
