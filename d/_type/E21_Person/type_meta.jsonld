In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity. \r\n\r\n## Examples: \r\n\r\n- Tut-Ankh-Amun \r\n- Nelson Mandela\r\n",
