It does not represent the act of creating the first physical carrier of the E28 Conceptual Object. As an example, this is the composition of a poem, not its commitment to paper.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- the composition of \"The Four Friends\" by A. A. Milne (E65) has created \"The Four Friends\" by A. A. Milne (E28)\r\n\r\n",
