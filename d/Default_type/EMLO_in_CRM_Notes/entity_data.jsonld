  "rdfs:comment": "# Notes for modeling EMLO in CRM\r\n\r\n## About this Annalist collection\r\n\r\nThis collection is an exploration of using linked data, CIDOC CRM and Annalist to model the contents of the [EMLO database](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/).\r\n\r\n## Annalist links\r\n\r\n- [List letters described in collection]($COLL:l/Letter/?scope=all)\r\n- [List people and organizations described in collection]($COLL:l/E39_Actor/?scope=all)\r\n- [List activities described in collection]($COLL:l/E7_Activity?scope=all)\r\n\r\n- [Entity types used to model EMLO data]($BASE:_type)\r\n- [Fields used to capture relationships between EMLO types]($BASE:_field)\r\n\r\n## Main classes used to model EMLO content:\r\n\r\n###  [Letter]($BASE:_type/Letter)\r\n\r\nDescribes a letter from the EMLO dataset.\r\n\r\nDeclared as a subtype of both [F1_Work]($BASE:_type/F1_Work) and [F2_Expression]($BASE:_type/F2_Expression).  This might turn out to be an ontological over-commitment, in which case treat as an F2_Expression.\r\n\r\nThis in turn is a subtype of various other CIDOC CRM classes, including [E70_Thing]($BASE:_type/E70_Thing) and [E77_Persistent_Item]($BASE:_type/E77_Persistent_Item).\r\n\r\n### [E39_Actor]($BASE:_type/E39_Actor)\r\n\r\nThis is a CIDOC CRM class used to describe actors in events.  It is used in the EMLO data representation to describe the sender and recipient of a letter (which in the EMLO data may be a person or an organization).  Correspondents who are natural persons may be described as instances of [E21_Person]($BASE:_type/E21_Person), which is a subclass of E39_Actor, and will allow for additional information such as birth and death to be included in their description.\r\n\r\n### Creation activity\r\n\r\nRepresents the creation (conception and authoring) of a letter.\r\n\r\nEMLO represents this by fields stored with data about the letter itself.  The CRM (and PROV) approach is to separate activities from artifacts so that more detailed information about the specific provenance and history of an artifact can be captured.\r\n\r\nThis is represented by the CRM class [crm:E65_Creation]($BASE:_type/E65_Creation), which is a subclass of [crm:E7_Activity]($BASE:_type/E7_Activity).\r\n\r\n### Transmission activity\r\n\r\nRepresents the transmission of a letter to its recipient.\r\n\r\nEMLO represents this by fields stored with data about the letter itself.  The CRM (and PROV) approach is to separate activities from artifacts so that more detailed information about the specific provenance and history of an artifact can be captured.\r\n\r\nThis is represented by a new class [emlo:Transmission]($BASE:_type/Transmission), which itself is a subclass of [crm:E7_Activity]($BASE:_type/E7_Activity).\r\n\r\nNote that a letter, as modeled, is a conceptual entity (F1_Work and F2_Expression) rather than a physical object. Thus, the specific CRM class [E10_Transfer_of_Custody]($BASE:_type/E10_Transfer_of_Custody) would not be applicable here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### @@etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main database entry types\r\n\r\nPer Mat, the main entry types are:\r\n\r\n- work; e.g. [this letter from Sir Isaac Newton](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/2aac1eaa-3d1e-46b4-9a81-500f5bca3666)\r\n- person (a person entity can also represent an organisation); e.g. [Sir Isaac Newton](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/person/d9634499-a63e-405c-9545-d74742523bca)\r\n- location; e.g. [London, England](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/location/283a71a7-cf68-4832-a381-9bf5388e1860)\r\n- manifestation @@example?\r\n    - Appears to be information appearing as \"Repositories and Versions\" in the description of a letter (work)?\r\n- resource @@example?\r\n    - Appears to be any/all data-derived links appearing in the item page\r\n- comment @@example?\r\n- institution; e.g. [Bodleian Library, University of Oxford](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/institution/fb5a417f-7f14-4b36-aac6-419ce9a0de6c) (there seems to be a problem with this link - it returns  search results rather than info about the institution)\r\n    - Is there some confusion or overlap between \"institution\" and \"repository\"?  Are they the same tyhing in EMLO?\r\n- role @@example?\r\n- subject @@example?\r\n\r\nThere also appear to be:\r\n\r\n- collections (e.g. [\r\nThe Bodleian card catalogue](http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=bodleian-card-catalogue))\r\n- images (e.g. [This Bodleian card image](http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/image/5d098bd0-ae5c-497e-90eb-a43fd88e74ed))\r\n    - Appears to be a property of a \"manifestation\"?\r\n\r\n- @@TODO: add more as encountered\r\n\r\n### work\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the type of entry used for describing letters.  The term \"work\" appeals to the FRBR notion (modelled in CIDOC CRM/FRBRoo as [F1_Work]($BASE:_type/F1_Work), but I wonder if a FRBR expression (modeled as [F2_Expression]($BASE:_type/F2_Expression)) wouldn't be closer.\r\n\r\nSee also: [FRBR **Work** and **Expression**](https://archive.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr_current3.htm#3.2).\r\n\r\n### person (a person entity can also represent an organisation)\r\n\r\nLooks to me like a [CRM E39_Actor]($BASE:_type/E39_Actor).\r\n\r\nCRM provides separate subtypes for individual people ([E21_Person]($BASE:_type/E21_Person)) and groups including organizations (E74_Group).\r\n\r\n### location\r\n\r\n### manifestation\r\n\r\nThe examples seen so far seem to be loosely related to FRBR manifestation, but also covering things like catalogue entries as well as realizations of the letter expression.  \r\n\r\nFRBRoo modeling is a bit confusing in this area, providing both F3_Manifestation_Product_Type and F4_Manifestation_Singleton types.  (There is also a separate F5_Item type.)\r\n\r\nThis *is* a manifestation (of the letter) in the FRBR sense, but in some cases, the image provided is not; e.g. may be an image of a cataloguing card.\r\n\r\n### resource\r\n\r\nLooks like web references - could map these to [Annalist journal resources](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/c/Journal_defs/d/_view/Web_resource/)?\r\n\r\n### comment\r\n\r\n### institution\r\n\r\n### role\r\n\r\nRelates to person (E55_Type?)\r\n\r\n### subject\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\n## Example to prove modeling\r\n\r\nhttp://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/2aac1eaa-3d1e-46b4-9a81-500f5bca3666\r\n\r\n",
